I work as a senior react developer at Deriv. In my free time, I like to contribute to the community by creating open-source projects and writing about web development, code, testing, tools, and sometimes life. Also, I enjoy using SASS in the projects. Currently, I’m focused on mastering React and TypeScript.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family, watching movies, reading books, and playing video games on Xbox.
